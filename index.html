	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, geneva, sans-serif; ">I believe that I would be a great student at Launch Academy because I am passionate about learning, creating, and technology. I enjoy problem-solving and working in a collaborative environment to develop creative solutions for a given scenario. While many people fear challenge, I believe that we grow the most during challenging times. Challenges test our commitment, passion, and will to persevere.</span></span></span></p><br>

	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, geneva, sans-serif; ">Once I graduate Launch Academy, I would like to be a developer. I am also currently working on starting a business, Abstract Learning Labs, that develops apps and creative solutions for education. It is very much in its infancy stage, with one school piloting the first web-based app, edYOUsched, that allows schools to implement a flexible learning period(s). The app was built with an app builder, but has gotten quite a bit of local and regional attention.&nbsp; The app will be presented at a New England regional education conference in March. While I do have this up and running, I would really love to learn how to build from scratch.</span></span></span></p><br>
			
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, geneva, sans-serif; ">Some of my favorite sites include <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/11/dogs-dont-understand-basic-concepts.html">Hyperbole and a Half</a> - for a good laugh; <a href="http://www.geogebra.org/cms/en/">GeoGebra</a> - for my inner math nerd; <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/tre0913/">Pinterest</a> - for the right side of my brain; and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thollingsworth">Facebook</a> - where my introvert and extrovert qualities battle it out. As for my hobbies - I enjoy seeing the beauty of places, like Acadia National Park (which I live near) and spending time with my family/dogs.</span></span></p><br>
